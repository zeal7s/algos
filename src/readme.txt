/**********************************************************************
 *  Explain briefly how you implemented the randomized queue and deque.
 *  Which data structure did you choose (array, linked list, etc.)
 *  and why?
 **********************************************************************/
PUT YOUR ANSWER HERE
RandomizedQueue is implemented via an array, instead of a linked list.
Because the time complexity of the array-based shuffle operation is O(N), 
while the time complexity of the linked-list-based shuffle operation is 
O(N^2).
